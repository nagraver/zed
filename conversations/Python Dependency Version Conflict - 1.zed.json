Let me break down what the error is saying:\n\n1. The error title in Russian asks \"What doesn't it like?\" (ЧТо ему не нравится)\n\n2. The main issue is Python version compatibility:\n   - The current project is configured to support Python >=3.13\n   - However, the `langchain` package requires Python <4.0,>=3.9\n   - Since Python 3.13 is within that range (it's between 3.9 and 4.0), there must be some other conflict\n\n3. The specific problem appears to be:\n   - The project has a dependency on langchain with version constraint `^0.3.23` (meaning 0.3.23 or higher but less than 0.4.0)\n   - But no version of langchain within that range (>0.3.23,<0.4.0) is compatible with the project's Python version requirements\n   - langchain version 0.3.23 itself requires Python <4.0,>=3.9\n\n4. The suggested solution is to:\n   - Check the Python requirements for dependencies\n   - For `langchain`, set the Python property to \">=3.13,<4.0\" in the Poetry configuration (pyproject.toml)\n\nThis is a dependency resolution error that often happens with Poetry when there are conflicting version requirements. The solution involves adjusting the Python version constraints in the pyproject.toml file.\n</think>\n\n# Poetry Dependency Resolution Error\n\nThe error is showing a Python version compatibility issue with your dependencies. Let me explain what's happening:\n\n## The Problem\n\nYour project is configured to use Python >=3.13, but there's a conflict with the `langchain` package:\n\n1. Your project depends on `langchain ^0.3.23` (which means versions 0.3.23 up to but not including 0.4.0)\n2. `langchain` requires Python >=3.9,<4.0\n3. Poetry can't find a version of `langchain` that satisfies all these constraints together\n\n## Solution\n\nYou need to explicitly specify the Python version range for the `langchain` dependency in your `pyproject.toml` file:\n\n```toml\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython = \">=3.13,<4.0\"\nlangchain = {version = \"^0.3.23\", python = \">=3.13,<4.0\"}\n```\n\nThis tells Poetry that you want to use `langchain` specifically with Python 3.13, which should be compatible since `langchain` works with Python 3.9-4.0.\n\nIf you continue having issues, you may need to check if `langchain` version 0.3.23 has been properly tested with Python 3.13, as 3.13 is very recent and some packages might not have been updated for it yet.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":43}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":8},"start":39,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":44}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":15},"start":1003,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":45}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":3492,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":46}}}],"summary":"Python Dependency Version Conflict","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":1003,"end":2360}}]}
